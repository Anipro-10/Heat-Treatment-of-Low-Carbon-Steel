# Heat Treatment of Low Carbon Steel

This repository documents the experimental study on the effects of different heat treatment methods—**Annealing**, **Normalizing**, and **Quenching**—on the microstructure and hardness of mild steel.

## 🔬 Objective

To investigate how different cooling rates during heat treatment affect:
- Grain size and morphology
- Phase distribution (ferrite, pearlite, martensite)
- Mechanical properties, particularly hardness

## 🛠️ Methodology

### Sample Preparation
- Mild steel rods were cut into 4 equal specimens (~1.2 cm length).
- Samples were mechanically polished (SiC paper and cloth) for microstructural analysis.

### Heat Treatment Procedures
| Treatment   | Heating Temp | Hold Time | Cooling Method |
|-------------|--------------|-----------|----------------|
| Annealing   | 900°C        | 1 hour    | Furnace cooling |
| Normalizing | 900°C        | 1 hour    | Air cooling     |
| Quenching   | 900°C        | 1 hour    | Water quenching |

### Microstructural Analysis
- Optical microscopy at 10x, 20x, 30x magnification
- Grain size and phase identification (ferrite, pearlite, martensite)

### Hardness Testing
- Vickers Microhardness Test
  - **Annealed**: 50 gf
  - **Normalized/Quenched**: 100 gf

## 📊 Results

| Sample     | Avg. Hardness (HV) | Error bar(±) |
|------------|--------------------|--------------|
| Annealed   | 149                | 4            |
| Normalized | 199                | 8.6          |
| Quenched   | 461                | 51           |

- **Annealed**: Large equiaxed grains, softest, highest ductility  
- **Normalized**: Finer grains, visible lamellar pearlite, increased hardness  
- **Quenched**: Lath martensite, diffusionless transformation, highest hardness

## 🔍 Key Observations

- **Cooling rate directly influences microstructure and hardness**
- **Martensitic transformation** in quenched samples leads to high hardness
- **Visible pearlite lamellae** in normalized steel due to faster cooling than annealing
- **Equiaxed polyhedral grains** typical in slow-cooled, annealed steel
